# Pomodoro Clock
An adjustable pomodoro clock written in plain HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. The app allows user input for work and break interval, including dynamic changes for the following cycle while in use (if clock is running and user changes parameters, the app will adjust while in progress, for the next round). All cycle changes are notified with an audible alarm. The app enforces a 15 minute break after four work cycles. This can easily be changed within the countdown function's use of the `restLength` variable on line 85 in the JavaScript. Audio alarm may not be supported on all mobile devices, particularly iOS.
